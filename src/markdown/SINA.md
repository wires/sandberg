# Social Innovation Academy (SINA)
## Jangu e.V., Uganda

The Social Innovation Academy (SINA) is a unique learning environment
based on the notion of "freesponsibility" to unleash the potential of
individuals. It transcends Ugandaâ€™s current education model, which does
more harm than good for the country, conditioning people to seek jobs
rather than create them. SINA empowers marginalized youth to become job
creators by nurturing innovative project ideas into social enterprises.
Hierarchical structures are at a minimum at SINA and respect and
motivation are intrinsic values. Students leave the academy with an
established social business.

SINA is a leading edge, inclusive academy with no formal entry
requirements. In open learning spaces and systemic social labs, students
tackle socio-economic and environmental problems in self-organized
projects. Waste is viewed as a useful resource for innovative projects
and social businesses. For example, briquettes are made from biomass;
human and animal waste feed a biogas system; empty cement sacks are used
for urban gardening and rainwater is harvested in a huge underground
tank. SINA is a sustainable ecosystem with a positive carbon
footprint. Its learning spaces are built from waste materials,
protecting the environment and providing a model for seeing waste
differently and stopping its production entirely.

SINA spearheads a holistic entrepreneurial concept that incubates
innovative student ideas promoting social and environmental value
rather than profit. Innovative project ideas designed to solve a
social or environmental challenge have their monetary profit doubled
by SINA for their project incubation. Projects creating value for
both society and the environment have their monetary profit tripled
to accelerate growth into a social enterprise. A functioning social
business is given start-up capital and assisted in business
registration. When it is running successfully, the business later
returns part of their profits to SINA for the start-up and
incubation of new social businesses.
