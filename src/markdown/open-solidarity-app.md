# Open solidarity app

## Solidaritas.net, Indonesia

*Open Solidarity App* is a leading edge smartphone application for
reporting discrimination and violation of freedom of association for
workers in the Cikarang industrial areas of Bekasi, West Java. It is
also used to promote the values of an open society and freedom and
equality in the workplace, including gender equality, anti-racism and
freedom of association.

Bekasi is the centre of growth of the Indonesian labour movement, with
about 1.5 million workers working in 5000 factories in seven major
industrial parks. Currently, workers in Indonesia experience the
violation of their freedoms on various levels, including violation of
the freedom of association law at factory level; gender discrimination;
and discrimination based on religion, race and ethnicity. Trades unions
are in their infancy in Indonesia and workers have no experience in
fighting for democracy as a result of Suhartoâ€™s New Order era.

Solidaritas is capitalising on current technology to drive systemic and
social change. Its original smartphone app encourages workers to
participate in solving their labour problems through solidarity. It
creates awareness among workers on the importance of freedom, democracy
and equality, stimulating open mindedness about gender, race, and sexual
orientation. Moreover, the app informs and enlightens workers about
weaknesses in existing labour laws and promotes the concept of fighting
for their right to freedom of association and an open society. Improved
awareness will empower workers and help them to improve their
working conditions. In addition to encouraging solidarity, the
complaints service aspect of this smartphone app has added value as
it will map discrimination and violence against workers in the
project area.
